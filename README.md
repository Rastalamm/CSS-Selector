# CSS Selector
Hello Awesome Programmer Person, My name is Ray and I need a tool built that will help other students visualize how CSS Selectors work. This tool can be added to any HTML document you have. This tool should:

1. Provide a way for a user to input CSS selector code into a form or something. I think they look like `#header` or sometimes `.messages` I dont know, you know CSS right?
2. After the user submits the CSS code, your tool will highlight all the HTML things that it finds. Maybe a Yellow Background color? Something bright!
3. If the tool doesn't find anything, maybe let the user know somehow? I dont know, it's up to you.
4. Maybe practice on your own HTML file.

[Someone made this, I think you could make it better](http://sgnl.github.io/css-selector-practice/)

Thaaaaaaaanks :D
